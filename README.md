## Amazon_Vine_Analysis ##
Module 16 Challenge using AWS, PySpark, Pandas, SQL for an ETL process
  
### Overview of the analysis of the Amazon Vine program ###  
  

### Results of the analysis ###  
  
  
### Summary ###
  
There is approximately a 5% difference of 5-star reviews in Vine to non-Vine reviews (40.61% to 45.34%).

Although the number of Vine reviews is pretty low, so far it can still represent the product. However, the average rating from Vine customers is 4.38 with std deviation of 0.78, and this is much higher than the 3.77 from non-Vine customers.

I believe the Vine customers tend to give higher ratings and pretty focusing on the higher ratings too. So reviews from Vine customers are not that trustworthy for me.
